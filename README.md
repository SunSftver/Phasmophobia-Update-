# Instructions for installing the Hack

How to unpack a file?

In 95% of cases files for games are in .RAR or .ZIP format. The former can be downloaded and unpacked with a trial version of the program WinRAR. To do so, open archive with that program and click on "Extract to" and select any folder on your hard drive, but do not select the folder with the game, because the archive may contain subfolders, and then the file will not work.

If the file is packed in a ZIP-archive, it will be enough to open it using the standard Windows "Explorer". Sometimes you may encounter archives with the extension .7Z, to unpack them, you will need to download the archiver 7-Zip. It is free and fairly convenient, and in addition can work with .RAR and a bunch of other, less popular types of archives.

How to install the cheat?

When you have unpacked the archive, find it using "Explorer" and look through the contents of the folder. Usually the cheat is a single file with the extension .EXE, but sometimes it may include other files as well as instructions (usually called ReadMe.txt).

The way of installation is the same for all cheats and consists in placing all files into the distribution of the game in the same folder where the executable file is located. Sometimes it is not easy to find, but if you have an icon on your desktop, which can be used to start the game, you can use the following method:

1. Right-click on the icon;
2. In the context menu that opens, select the "Properties" option;
3. In the opened window go to the "Shortcut" tab and click the "File location" button.

After that, the "Explorer" will open a folder that contains the EXE file of the game. The cheat should be copied into the same folder, unless otherwise stated in the instructions attached to the cheat.

After that, it will only be necessary to run the cheat and familiarize yourself with the keyboard shortcuts to activate its features, and then, without closing the cheat, run the game.
